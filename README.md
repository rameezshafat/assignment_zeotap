# Data Science Internship Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains all files related to the Data Science Internship assignment, which includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, a **Lookalike Model**, and **Customer Segmentation using Clustering**.

## Repository Structure

| File Name                  | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `Customers.csv`            | Customer details (ID, Name, Region, Signup Date) |
| `Products.csv`             | Product details (ID, Name, Category, Price) |
| `Transactions.csv`         | Transactions data (Transaction ID, Customer ID, Product ID, Date, Quantity, Value) |
| `Lookalike.csv`            | Lookalike model output (Top 3 similar customers for selected customers) |
| `Customer_Segmentation.csv`| Clustering results (Customer ID mapped to clusters) |
| `assignment.ipynb`         | Jupyter Notebook with code implementation |
| `business report.pdf`      | Business insights report from EDA |
| `clustering report.pdf`    | Clustering analysis report |

## Tasks Completed ✅
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 📊
   - Sales trends, product category insights, and customer distributions analyzed.
2. **Lookalike Model** 🏷️
   - Implemented a recommendation system to find similar customers.
3. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)** 🔍
   - Performed clustering with **Davies-Bouldin Index** evaluation.
   - Optimized the number of clusters and visualized results.

## How to Run the Notebook 🏃‍♂️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo.git
   cd your_repo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If needed
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in sequence to generate outputs.

## Key Insights 🧐
- Identified seasonal trends in sales for better inventory management.
- Found top-performing product categories.
- Customer segmentation helps in targeted marketing strategies.

## Next Steps 📌
- Further refine the Lookalike Model using **purchase behavior patterns**.
- Improve clustering by integrating more customer attributes.
- Apply **Machine Learning models** to predict customer spending behavior.
